# Node.js Express Backend Skeleton

This is a basic Node.js Express backend skeleton.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```

The server will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.

## Project Structure
- `index.js`: Main entry point and Express server setup.

## Customization
Add your routes and middleware as needed in `index.js` or split into separate files for larger projects.
