# Node.js Express Backend

This is the backend for the Blogs project, built with Node.js and Express.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   The server will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.

## Structure
- `index.js`: Main entry point and Express server setup
- `controller/`: Contains route controllers (e.g., `blogController.js`, `userController.js`)

## Customization
- Add routes and middleware in `index.js` or split into separate files for larger projects.
- Configure environment variables in `.env` (not committed to git).
